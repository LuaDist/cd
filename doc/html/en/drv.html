<h1>Drivers</h1>

  <p>Driver is the implementation of functions of a canvas for a specific canvas 
  type. In other words it represents the context in which the canvas is 
  situated. For example, a Window System that has windows on which you can draw.
  </p>
  <p>It can be portable, platform independent, or it can has a different 
  implementation in each platform. In this case its functions may have different 
  behaviors, but the library is implemented in such a way that these differences 
  are minimized. </p>
