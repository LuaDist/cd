<h2 style="text-align: left">CD_DBUFFER - Double Buffer Driver using a server image (cddbuf.h)</h2>

  <p>Implements the concept of offscreen drawing. It is based on a Server Image 
  (the back buffer) and a Window canvas (the front buffer).</p>

<h3>Use</h3>

  <p>The canvas is created by means of a call to function
  <a href="../func/init.html#cdCreateCanvas">
  <font face="Courier"><strong>cdCreateCanvas</strong></font></a><font face="Courier">(CD_DBUFFER, 
  Data)</font>, after which other functions in the CD library can be called as 
  usual. This function creates a CD canvas to use with an existing window canvas 
  (Native Windows or IUP). The parameter <font face="Courier">Data</font> is a 
  pointer to the already created canvas.</p>
  <p>Any amount of such canvases may exist simultaneously. It is important to 
  note that a call to function
  <a href="../func/init.html#cdKillCanvas">
  <font face="Courier"><strong>cdKillCanvas</strong></font></a> is required to 
  properly <b>end</b> the driver. Call function
  <a href="../func/init.html#cdKillCanvas">
  <font face="Courier"><strong>cdKillCanvas</strong></font></a> for this driver 
  before calling <font face="Courier"><strong>cdKillCanvas</strong></font> for 
  the window driver.</p>
  <p>The drawing functions will work normally as if they were drawn on 
  the server image driver. When function <font face="Courier"><b>
  <a href="../func/control.html#cdFlush">
  cdCanvasFlush</a></b></font> is executed, the image is drawn in the window canvas 
  passed as parameter in the canvas creation.</p>
  <p>When the window's size changes, the server image is automatically recreated 
  using the same size as the canvas. This is done in the function
  <font face="Courier"><b>
  <a href="../func/init.html#cdActivate">
  cdCanvasActivate</a></b></font>.</p>
<p>We suggest you to implement rubber bands using XOR directly on the front 
buffer.</p>

<h3>Behavior of Functions</h3>

  <p>This driver is very platform-dependent. </p>

  <p>For further detail, see the <b>
  Behavior of Functions</b> in each base driver: <a href="win32.html">GDI</a>, 
	<a href="gdk.html">GDK</a> and <a href="xwin.html">X-Win</a>. To use this driver 
	with a context plus base driver is necessary to call 
  <font face="Courier"><strong>
  cdUseContextPlus</strong></font><strong><font face="Courier">(1)</font></strong> 
  before creating the canvas, see the <a href="../drv/gdiplus.html">GDI+</a>,&nbsp;<a href="../drv/cairo.html">Cairo</a> 
and <a href="../drv/xrender.html">XRender</a> base drivers.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that some functions behave differently from the 
basic functions of each platform.</p>
<h4>Control</h4>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../func/control.html#cdFlush"><font face="Courier"><strong>Flush</strong></font></a>: 
  draws the contents of the image into the window. It is affected by <strong>
  Origin</strong> and <strong>Clipping</strong>, but not by <strong>WriteMode</strong>.</li>
</ul>
