<h1>Guide</h1>
<h3><a name="start">Getting Started</a></h3>

  <p>The CD library is a basic graphic library (GL). In a GL paradigm you use <strong>primitives</strong>, which have
  <strong>attributes</strong>, to draw on a <strong>canvas</strong>. All the library functions reflect this paradigm.</p>
  <p>The <strong>canvas</strong> is the basic element. It can have several forms: a paper, a video monitor, a graphic 
  file format, etc. The virtual drawing surface where the canvas exists is represented by a <strong>driver</strong>. 
  Only the driver knows how to draw on its surface. The user does not use the driver directly, but only the canvas.</p>
  <p>To make the library simple we use the concept of an active canvas, over which all the primitives are drawn. This 
  also allows the use of an expansion mechanism using function tables. Unfortunately if a function is called without an 
  active canvas a memory invasion will occur. On the other hand, the mechanism allows the library to be expanded with 
  new drivers without limits.</p>
  <p>The <strong>attributes</strong> are also separated from the primitives. They reside in the canvas in a state 
  mechanism. If you change the attribute's state in the canvas all the primitives drawn after that canvas and that 
  depend on the attribute will be drawn in a different way.</p>
  <p>The set of <strong>primitives</strong> is very small but complete enough to compose a GL. Some primitives are 
  system dependent for performance reasons. Some drivers (window and device based) use system functions to optimally 
  implement the primitives. Sometimes this implies in a in small different behavior of some functions. Also some 
  primitives do not make sense in some drivers, like server images in file-based drivers.</p>
  <p>The set of available functions is such that it can be implemented in most drivers. Some drivers have sophisticated 
  resources, which cannot be implemented in other drivers but can be made available using a generic attribute 
  mechanism.

<h3><a name="buildapp">Building Applications</a></h3>

  <p>All the CD functions are declared in the <tt>cd.h</tt> header file; World Coordinate functions are declared in the
  <tt>wd.h</tt> header file; and each driver has a correspondent header file that must be included to create a canvas. 
  It is important to include each driver header <u>after</u> the inclusion of the <tt>cd.h</tt> header file.</p>
  <p>To link the application you must add the <b>cd.lib/libcd.a/libcd.so</b> and <b>
	freetype6.lib/libfreetype.a/libfreetype.so </b> libraries to the linker options. If you use 
  an IUP Canvas then you must also link with the <b>iupcd.lib/libiupcd.a/libiupcd.so</b> library 
	available in the IUP distribution.</p>
  <p>In UNIX, CD uses GDK or the Xlib (X11) libraries. To statically link an application in UNIX 
  with CD, add also the GDK or the X11 libraries.</p>
  <p>The download files list includes the <a href="download_tips.html">Tecgraf/PUC-Rio Library 
  Download Tips</a> document, with a description of all the available binaries.</p>

<h3 align="left"><a name="buildlib">Building the Library</a> </h3>

<p>In the Downloads you will be able to find pre-compiled binaries for many 
platforms, all those binaries were built using Tecmake. Tecmake is a command line multi compiler build tool 
based on GNU make, available at
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/tecmake">http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/tecmake</a>. Tecmake is 
  used by all the Tecgraf libraries and many applications.</p>
<p>In UNIX, you do not need to install Tecmake, a version for Posix systems is 
already included in the source code package. Just type &quot;make&quot; in the command 
line on the &quot;src&quot; folder and all libraries will be build. Set the TECTOOLS_HOME 
environment variable to the folder were the IM and Lua libraries are installed, 
by default it will assume &quot;TECTOOLS_HOME=../..&quot;.</p>
<p>In Linux, check the &quot;<a href="building.html">Building Lua, IM, CD and IUP in 
Linux</a>&quot; guide.</p>
<p>In Windows, the easiest way to build everything is to install the Tecmake tool into your system. It is easy and helps a lot. 
  The Tecmake configuration files (*.mak) available at the &quot;src&quot; folder are very easy to understand also. 
There are files named 
<i>make_uname.bat</i> that build the libraries using <b>Tecmake</b>. To build for Windows using 
  Visual C 9.0 (2008) for example, just execute <i>&quot;make_uname vc9&quot;</i> , or 
for the 
DLLs type <i>&quot;make_uname dll9&quot;</i>. The Visual 
Studio workspaces with the respective projects available in the source package 
is for debugging purposes only.</p>
<p>If you don't want to install Tecmake you can use the version for Windows 
systems that is included in the source code package. BUt is is more complicated 
that its Posix counterpart. First the GNU make must be installed and in the PATH 
before other makes. In the command line you must specify the compiler path and 
the TEC_UNAME variable. For example:</p>
<pre>make -f tecmakewin.mak TEC_UNAME=mingw4 MINGW4=c:/mingw 
make -f tecmakewin.mak TEC_UNAME=gcc4 GCC4=c:/cygwin           (Cygwin building for Win32)</pre>
<p>Make sure you have all the dependencies for the library you want installed, 
see the documentation bellow.</p>
<p>If you are going to build all the libraries, 
the makefiles and projects expect the following directory tree:</p>
<pre>\mylibs\
        cd\
        im\
        lua5.1\</pre>

(*) In Windows, &quot;<strong>cdwin</strong>&quot; is called &quot;<strong>cd</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>cdgdiplus</strong>&quot; is called &quot;<strong>cdcontextplus</strong>&quot;. 
    In Linux and BSD &quot;<strong>cdgdk+cdcairo</strong>&quot; is called &quot;<strong>cd</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>cdxrender</strong>&quot; is called &quot;<strong>cdcontextplus</strong>&quot;. 
    In IRIX, AIX and SunOS &quot;<strong>cdx11</strong>&quot; is called &quot;<strong>cd</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>cdxrender</strong>&quot; is called &quot;<strong>cdcontextplus</strong>&quot;.</pre>

<p>As a general rule (excluding system dependencies and included third party 
libraries): CD has NO external dependencies, and CDLua depends on Lua and IMLua. 
Just notice that not all CDLua libraries depend on IMLua.</p>
<p>The Lua bindings for IUP, CD and IM (Makefiles and Pre-compiled binaries) 
depend on the <a href="http://luabinaries.luaforge.net/">LuaBinaries</a> 
distribution. So if you are going to build all use the <strong>LuaBinaries</strong> 
source package also, not the <strong>Lua.org</strong> original source package. 
If you like to use another location for the Lua files define LUA_SUFFIX, LUA_INC, 
LUA_LIB and LUA_BIN before using Tecmake or Tecmake Compact.</p>
<p>In Ubuntu you will need to install the following packages:</p>
<pre>libx11-dev
libxpm-dev
libxmu-dev
libxft-dev (for the XRender driver)
libgtk2.0-dev (for the GDK driver)</pre>

<h3><a name="Environment">Environment Variables</a></h3>

  <p><font face="Courier New"><b>CDDIR</b></font> - This environment variable is used by some drivers to locate useful 
  data files, such as font definition files. It contains the directory path without the final slash.<br>
  <font face="Courier New"><b>CD_QUIET</b></font> - In UNIX, if this variable is defined, it does not show the library's 
  version info on <em>sdtout</em>.<br>
  <font face="Courier New"><b>CD_</b></font><b><font face="Courier New">XERROR</font></b> - In UNIX, if this variable is 
  defined, it will show the X-Windows error messages on <em>sdterr</em>.</p>

<h3><a name="NewDriver">Implementing a Driver</a></h3>

  <p>The best way to implement a new driver is based on an existing one. For this reason, we provide 
  a code of the 
  simplest driver possible, see <a href="../download/cdxx.h">CDXX.H</a> and <a href="../download/cdxx.c">CDXX.C</a>. 
  But first you should read the <a href="internal.html">Internal Architecture</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="Play">Intercepting Primitives</a></h3>

  <p>To fill data structures of library primitives during a <font face="Courier New">cdPlay</font> call you must 
  implement a driver and activate it before calling <font face="Courier New">cdPlay</font>. Inside your driver 
  primitives you can fill your data structure with the information interpreted by the <font face="Courier New">cdPlay</font> 
  function.</p>

<h3><a name="IUP">IUP Compatibility</a></h3>

  <p>The <strong>IupCanvas</strong> element of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/">IUP</a> 
  interface toolkit can be used as a visualization surface for a CD canvas. There are two moments in which one must be 
  careful when an application is using both libraries: when creating the CD canvas, and when changing the size of the 
  IUP canvas.</p>
  <h4>Creating the CD Canvas</h4>
  
    <p>The CD_IUP driver parameter needs only the Ihandle* of the <strong>
	IupCanvas</strong>. But <strong>cdCreateCanvas</strong> must be called <u>after</u> the <strong>IupCanvas</strong> element has been 
    mapped into the native system.</p>
    <p>But a call to <strong>IupShow</strong> generates an ACTION callback. And a 
	direct call to <strong>IupMap</strong> can generate a RESIZE_CB callback.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>So the best way to create a CD canvas for a IUP canvas is to use the
	<strong>IupCanvas</strong> MAP_CB callback. This callback will be always called before 
	any other callback.</p>
    
    <p>The application must be linked with the <strong>iupcd</strong> 
    library that it is available in the IUP package.</p>
  
  <h4>Resizing the IUP Canvas</h4>
  
    <p>When a IupCanvas is resized the CD canvas must be notified of the size 
	change. To do that simply call <strong>cdCanvasActivate</strong> in the 
	RESIZE_CB callback.</p>
